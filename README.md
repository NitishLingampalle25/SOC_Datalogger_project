## 1. Motivation

Modern safety-critical transportation systems — most notably India's **Train Collision Avoidance System (TCAS/Kavach)** — depend on continuous, real-time logging of operational telemetry: train speed, signal aspect, brake pipe pressure, braking commands, and driver inputs. This data is the backbone of incident forensics, regulatory compliance, and post-accident investigation.

### Why this matters in real time

- Handling continuous high-rate sensor streams purely in software forces the CPU to repeatedly service interrupts and run memory-copy/crypto routines, causing pipeline stalls and jitter — and in the worst case, dropped telemetry during exactly the burst of activity (e.g. a hard brake) that investigators need most.
- Telemetry stored without hardware-level cryptographic protection is tamper-able, which undermines its value as forensic evidence.
- A firmware hang or bus deadlock, if undetected, can silently stop logging altogether with no operator awareness.

### How this project addresses it

This SoC offloads memory transfer, encryption, and health-monitoring to dedicated autonomous hardware blocks, so the control processor never becomes the bottleneck:

- **Zero telemetry loss** under sustained sensor throughput — hardware handshaking, not CPU polling
- **Constant-time, tamper-resistant cryptography** on every logged block — hardware AES, not a software library exposed to cache-timing side channels
- **Autonomous fault isolation** — a watchdog that can force recovery even if the CPU or DMA has completely locked up, with zero software involvement

> The direct benefit: a data logger that keeps recording accurately and securely exactly when the system is under the most stress — which is when the log matters most.

## 3. System Architecture & IPs Used

### Core Processor

**RISC-V Processor Core — VeeR EL2** (Western Digital / CHIPS Alliance)
Open-source, dual-issue 32-bit core implementing **RV32IMC**, with 32 KB ICCM and 64 KB DCCM. It is the control-plane master — configuring peripheral registers and handling top-level interrupts/fault vectors — while the closely-coupled memories let it run control code at deterministic, single-cycle latency without contending for the shared AXI bus. This is what makes non-blocking CPU execution possible even while DMA is saturating the bus.

### Bus Fabric

**Dual-Master AXI4-Lite Interconnect**
Crossbar with round-robin arbitration between Master 1 (RISC-V core) and Master 2 (DMA). Chosen for low area overhead and standardized handshaking; the round-robin arbiter is what gives the zero-starvation guarantee — high-bandwidth DMA traffic can never lock the CPU out of its control registers.

### The Six Integrated Peripheral IPs

| 1 | **AES Encryption Engine** (AXI4-Lite slave) | Hardware-accelerated AES-128/256 (ECB/CBC) over staged sensor blocks. Removes the latency and cache-timing side-channel risk of software crypto; its completion pulse doubles as the hardware "system alive" heartbeat for the watchdog. |
| 2 | **Bus-Mastering DMA Controller** (AXI4-Lite slave + master) | Moves UART telemetry into staging SRAM autonomously once a FIFO threshold is crossed — no CPU polling, no programmatic I/O. Its completion pulse triggers the AES engine directly. |
| 3 | **Watchdog Timer (WDT)** | Autonomous supervisor with an early-warning IRQ, an NMI line, and a hard reset line, all independent of software. Auto-kicked on every AES completion, so any hang anywhere in the pipeline is detected and recovered from without firmware intervention. |
| 4 | **UART** | Sensor ingest interface; asserts a hardware DMA request the moment its RX FIFO crosses a watermark, starting the autonomous pipeline with zero CPU involvement. |
| 5 | **GPIO / Timer** | Board-level I/O and timing references (baud generation, peripheral clocking) supporting the rest of the pipeline. |
| 6 | **Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC)** | Aggregates and priority-encodes interrupts from DMA, AES, UART, and WDT-warning into a single vectored line to the core, keeping CPU-side interrupt handling simple despite multiple autonomous blocks running in parallel. |

**Supporting element:** a 32 KB dual-port staging SRAM (Port A → AES, Port B → DMA/CPU) that decouples ingest from cryptographic processing, avoiding bus contention between the two.

### Key Architectural Guarantees

- **Hardware-synchronized autonomous pipeline:** UART → DMA → SRAM → AES → WDT kick, entirely in hardware, no software intervention.
- **Zero-starvation arbiter:** transaction-boundary round-robin locking bounds CPU wait time regardless of DMA load.
- **Non-blocking CPU execution:** the core only stalls if it explicitly issues an off-chip AXI transaction; otherwise it runs at full speed from ICCM/DCCM.
- **Privilege and bus protection:** Master 2 (DMA) is hardware-blocked from writing to CPU-only registers (AES keys, WDT control); unaligned accesses return SLVERR.

## 7. How to Build & Run

cd run

# Compile (recommended, with log capture)
vcs -full64 -sverilog -l compile.log -f run_interconnect_uart.f -o simv_ic_uart

# Simulate
./simv_ic_uart

# With Verdi waveforms
vcs -full64 -sverilog -debug_access+all -kdb -f run_interconnect_uart.f -o simv_ic_uart
./simv_ic_uart -verdi


## 8. Verification Status

The AXI-interconnect ↔ UART integration is verified with a directed 7-step test sequence. 

| 1 | Reset | Hold `rst_n` low for 20 clocks |
| 2 | LCR config | Write `0x03` (8N1) |
| 3 | BAUD config | Write `SIM_BAUD_DIV = 10` |
| 4 | THR write | Write `0x55` to transmit register |
| 5 | LSR poll TEMT | Wait for TX FIFO drain |
| 6 | RX injection | Drive byte `0xA5` on `uart_rx` (NRZ, LSB-first) |
| 7 | RBR read | Verify received byte equals `0xA5` |

**All 7 tests currently pass.**

This verified interconnect–UART block has since been **integrated into the RISC-V wrapper (VeeR EL2)**, and verification of that integrated block is **currently in progress**.

AES, DMA, WDT, and PIC integration into the full top-level SoC is planned next and not yet covered by any testbench — this section will be updated as each stage's verification lands.

## 9. Challenges & Debugging

| 1 | `NTSFM` — missing `` `timescale `` (1st attempt) | A shared `timescale.v` stub listed first in the filelist looked correct but doesn't propagate across file boundaries in VCS | — |
| 2 | `SVS` — SystemVerilog-only syntax | `rd = '0;` rejected outside full SV mode | Replaced with `{DATA_W{1'b0}}` |
| 3 | `NTSFM` — real root cause | VCS resets timescale context at every file boundary | Embedded `` `timescale `` inside each of the 6 UART source files individually |
| 4 | `TFIPC` — too few port connections | Tie-off logic for unused master ports (m01–m05) wired only the input side; 32 output ports per master were missing | Tied outputs to `()`, drove inputs with literals in the instantiation |
| 5 | `SIOB` + `NMCM` — OOB slice / negative replication | ID-width conversion assumed interconnect ID width ≥ UART's fixed 12-bit ID; it was actually 8-bit | Reversed conversion direction (zero-pad 8→12 in, truncate 12→8 out) |
| 6 | `UST` — undefined system task | `` `ifdef VCS `` always selected the FSDB dump branch (VCS defines that macro by default), but the Verdi/Novas PLI library wasn't loaded | Replaced with unconditional `$dumpfile` / `$dumpvars` |
| 7 | Runtime `$finish` — address width violation | Interconnect enforces a minimum 12-bit (4 KB) slave address aperture; UART's real footprint is 5 bits (32 B) | Set `M00_ADDR_WIDTH = 12`, unused address space returns SLVERR |
| 8 | Stale-binary false negative | Runtime error persisted post-fix because `simv_ic_uart` was a stale compiled binary | `build_ic_uart.sh` clears prior build artifacts before every recompile |

> **Recurring lesson:** several issues looked fixed after the first pass but weren't — the actual root cause in both the timescale bug and the stale-binary bug was *tool behavior* (per-file timescale reset, cached binaries), not the RTL itself.
